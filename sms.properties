## SMS Properties
##
## These properties configure iDART's sms features. Apart from the general settings
## there are 2 repeating sections, one for appointment reminders and one for 
## missed appointment notifications.
## 
## Appointment reminders
## ---------------------
## You can configure three different appointment reminders each with its own message
## and each one configured to remind people a certain number of days before their appointment.
## 
## For each reminder there are two properties that are required:
## * appointmentReminder{number}_daysBefore
## * appointmentReminder{number}_message_{language}
##
## {number} is used to number the different properties groups and can be either 1, 2, 3 or 4
## {language} is used to allow multiple language options per message and must be one of the
##				values in the "languages" property. Note that this must match one of the languages
##				exactly including case.
##
## Missed appointments
## -------------------
## You can configure three different missed appointment notifications each with its own message
## and each one configured to remind people a certain number of days after their appointment.
## 
## For each reminder there are two properties that are required:
## * missedAppointmentSms{number}_daysLate
## * missedAppointmentSms{number}_message_{language}
##
## {number} is used to number the different properties groups and can be either 1, 2, 3 or 4
## {language} is used to allow multiple language options per message and must be one of the
##				values in the "languages" property. Note that this must match one of the languages
##				exactly including case.
##
## Languages
## ---------
## As has already been discussed you can configure different messages for different languages.
## The list of languages is configured using the languages property which is a comma-separated
## list of language names. There must be a message property for each of the languages in this list.
##
## As well as being used to get the correct message text the values in this property will 
## appear in the language selection box on the 'Add participants to study' screen
##
## Example
## -------
## languages=English,French
##
## appointmentReminder1_daysBefore = 14
## appointmentReminder1_message_English=Your appointment is in 14 days time
## appointmentReminder2_message_French=Votre nomination est dans 14 jours le temps
##
## appointmentReminder2_daysBefore = 7
## appointmentReminder2_message_English=Your appointment is in 7 days time
## appointmentReminder2_message_French=Votre nomination est dans 7 jours le temps

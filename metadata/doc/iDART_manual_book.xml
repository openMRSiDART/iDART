		<title>Welcome to the iDART Pharmacy Tool</title>
		<simpara>
			iDART (which stands for the Intelligent Dispensing of
			Antiretroviral Treatment) is a tool designed to help
			pharmacists and pharmacy assistants with the monthly
			dispensing of antiretroviral drugs. iDART is designed in the
			context of a resource constrained environment, the public
			health sector in South Africa. iDART seeks to address many
			of the problems typical of this type of environment. The
			development of iDART was the result of collaboration work
			between Cell-Life and the Desmond Tutu HIV Centre, in Cape
			Town, South Africa. iDART is an open source project and the
			source code can be downloaded from
			http://idart.Cell-Life.org. It is released under GPL, so
			please feel free to distribute this program under its
			license agreement. Any thoughts or comments would be greatly
			appreciated. Please send these to idart@cell-life.org.za.

			<title>The Technology</title>
			<simpara>
				iDART is developed using open-source technologies and
				has been developed to run on any windows or linux based
				platform, allowing users to access and operate the
				system in a familiar and easy to use way. The choice for
				using open-source software is that there are no
				proprietary licensing costs associated with the use of
				the software. The use of open-source also allows for
				people to take the software for free and use it at their
				sites should they have the necessary skills to manage
				its operation. Each iDART installation operates with a
				barcode label printer connected to the PC which allows
				for each and every drug which is packaged to be clearly
				labelled. The labels which are printed upon dispensing
				can also be created in a range of languages depending on
				the ART site. The labels make for easy drug information
				and label packaging and eradicate many of the errors
				that occur through handwritten dosage instructions.
			</simpara>

		</sect1>
		<sect1>
			<title>The Reporting Tool</title>
			<simpara>
				One of the more important functions of iDART is in the
				various reports that the software makes available. The
				reports range from basic stock control management and
				monitoring reports to specific patient defaulter lists
				which allow for the easy management and follow-up of
				patients. iDART also keeps the entire patient history of
				a patient in its database and allows for accurate
				tracking of patients receiving treatment from ART sites.
				It is important to note that Cell-Life believe strongly
				in addressing the needs of each specific site and the
				technology used is flexible enough to include numerous
				other reports. Cell-Life believe that the technology
				implemented needs to assist the existing processes in
				place at sites and therefore looks to adapt the
				technology to best suit these needs.
			</simpara>

		</sect1>
		<sect1>
			<title>Down Referral or Decanting to remote clinics</title>
			<simpara>
				One of the great features of iDART is that it also
				allows for the decanting of packages to remote clinics
				and dispensaries that do not hold stock of ARVs. iDART
				allows a central ART site or pharmacy to prepare
				packages for a patients belonging to remote clinics and
				will trace the entire process until the patient collects
				their drugs. Feedback is then provided via the network
				to the central pharmacy to signal that the package was
				collected and the pharmacist is then allowed to package
				drugs for the patient in the next month. For more
				information on the decanting system please see the
				Cell-Life website. If you have any further queries on
				iDART please visit our website at www.Cell-Life.org or
				call 021 469 1111.

		<title>System Overview</title>
		<simpara>
			This section provides a short description of the function of
			iDART, and shows how the tool can be used in a pharmacy that
			dispenses antiretroviral drugs.
		</simpara>

		<simpara>
			iDart allows ARVs to be pre-packaged for collection by
			patients at a later time. The packaged drugs may either be
			collected at the pharmacy or at a remote clinic. iDART also
			allows users to dispense ARVs immediately to patients at a
			pharmacy.
		</simpara>

		<sect1>
			<title>Pre-packaging ARVs for patients</title>
			<simpara>
				For quick dispensing, iDART allows the pharmacist to
				pre-package a patient's ARVs. The patient may then
				collect their pre-packaged ARVs at the pharmacy or at a
				remote clinic. The date on which the ARVs were
				pre-packaged is recorded by iDART to assist with the
				tracking of the packages.
			</simpara>

			<sect2>
				<title>Collection at the pharmacy</title>
				<simpara>
					If the patient collects the packaged ARVs at the
					pharmacy, the date on which the package is collected
					as well as the date on which the package leaves the
					pharmacy are recorded as the current day.
				</simpara>

			</sect2>
			<sect2>
				<title>Collection at the local clinic</title>
				<simpara>
					Before a patient can collect the packaged ARVs at
					the local clinic, the packaged ARVs need to be
					transported from the pharmacy to the remote/local
					clinic. The date on which the packaged ARVs leave
					the pharmacy is recorded. The packaged drugs are
					then transported to the clinic. The clinic
					eventually receives the packaged ARVs and this date
					is recorded. Finally, when the patient arrives to
					collect his/her packaged ARVs, the date for
					collection is recorded.
				</simpara>

			</sect2>
		</sect1>
		<sect1>
			<title>
				Dispensing to patients at the pharmacy immediately
			</title>
			<simpara>
				If a patient arrives at the pharmacy to collect his/her
				ARVs and the ARVs have not been pre-packaged, iDART
				allows the pharmacist to package and dispense the
				required ARVs immediately. In this case, the date the
				package was packed, the date the package left the
				pharmacy and the date the package was picked up will all
				be recorded as the same day.
			</simpara>

		</sect1>
		<sect1>
			<title>Remote Dispensing Feature</title>
			<simpara>
				This section provides a more detailed description of the
				remote dispensing feature in iDART.
			</simpara>

			<simpara>
				Generally, ART consists of a monthly supply of 3
				different types of drugs. These 3 drugs need to be taken
				together. While it is customary for a pharmacist to
				dispense directly to a patient, iDART allows for
				pharmacist to create packages for each individual under
				their responsibility, at a central pharmacy. Labels are
				printed for each of the 3 drugs in the package, and each
				label has a reference to the individual patient. The
				pharmacist can then use a courier service to distribute
				the months supply to a remote rural or semi-rural
				clinic. It is at this clinic that the patient visits on
				a monthly basis to pick up their medications. In
				addition to the remote packaging of ARVs, iDART also
				allows for the direct dispensing of ARVs to a patient.
				Since there are two separate locations in the physical
				infrastructure, iDART consists of two separate
				applications. The first of these resides at the central
				pharmacy. The second application is housed at a service
				point or ARV site, where patients collect their
				medication from a nurse. Since both applications access
				the same database, the responsible pharmacist can assess
				each site that receives drugs from the central store, as
				well as assess all patients monitored on the system.

						</phrase>
					</textobject>
				</inlinemediaobject>
			</simpara>

			<simpara>
				Since the drugs are couriered to remote areas, it is
				very important for the responsible pharmacist to know
				the location of drugs at all stages of the distribution.
				For this reason, the packages are tracked at 4 specific
				times along the supply chain. Tracking normally happens
				by using a handheld barcode scanner. The first time we
				store information about the packaged drugs is when the
				package is first created. In other words, the time when
				the pharmacist has placed the 3 different drugs into a
				plastic package is recorded. The second time the package
				is tracked is when it leaves the pharmacy. The
				pharmacist scans out the package. When this happens, we
				know that the drugs are now in transit to the destined
				remote clinic. The third time the package is tracked is
				when it arrives at the remote clinic. The nurse working
				at this facility is responsible for receiving the
				packaged drugs from the driver, and scanning in the
				packages as a receipt of their arrival. The final time
				the package is tracked is when the patient visits the
				remote clinic to pick up their monthly supply of ARV.
				The package is then scanned out. By scanning this out, a
				feedback mechanism is created. In other words, the
				pharmacist can obtain the location and status of the
				packages between dispensing and patient pickup.

			Getting Started: Updating Pharmacy Details And Adding Drugs,
			Stock, Doctors, Patients and their Prescriptions
		</title>
		<simpara>
			The Basic Concepts section describes tasks you will need to
			perform to set up the system for your pharmacy. First, the
			pharmacy's details (such as address, telephone number etc)
			must be entered. Then, the ARV drugs that will be dispensed
			to patients (such as Efavirenz 200mg Capsules, Kaletra
			Solution etc) must be added. Once the drugs have been added,
			the stock levels for each drug must be recorded. If you
			would like iDART to store regimen information, you will also
			need to define the groups of ARV drugs that can be
			prescribed as regimen 1A, 1B or 2.
		</simpara>

		<simpara>
			Patients must be added next, followed by the doctors who
			will prescribe drugs to the patients. Existing prescriptions
			for the patients must then be recorded.
		</simpara>
	</chapter>
	<chapter>
		<title>The Pharmacy</title>
		<simpara>
			The system stores the pharmacy's name, address and phone
			number as well as the name of the pharmacist in charge. This
			information is printed on package and drug labels. In
			addition, the names of the pharmacist and pharmacy assistant
			are printed on all iDART reports.
		</simpara>

		<sect1>
			<title>Updating the Pharmacy's Details</title>
			<simpara>
				To update the pharmacy's information, log into the
				system and select General Admin from the main screen. A
				new screen, the General Admin Screen, will appear. From
				this screen, select Update the Pharmacy's Details in the
				Pharmacy Admin section. The Pharmacy Info screen will
				appear. It looks like this:

		<title>ARV Drugs</title>
		<simpara>
			The system stores all the ARV drugs that will be given to
			patients. The drug is referenced by its name, which should
			therefore include the abbreviation and strength. For
			example, you might have [d4t] Stavudine 30mg. You need to
			specify the chemical compounds in the drug, fill in the pack
			size, and select the form (tablets, solution etc) as this
			determines the dosage instructions that will be printed on
			the drug label. You can optionally specify a standard dosage
			for the drug. Before the existing stock of a drug can be
			recorded, it must be added as shown in this section. If you
			are unsure about drug attributes, try looking at the example
			with fields filled in, found in the Adding Drugs section.
		</simpara>

		<sect1>
			<title>Adding Drugs</title>

			reports.
		</simpara>

		<sect1>
			<title>Adding Stock</title>
			<simpara>
				The Stock Arrives screen must be used to add the stock
				to the database. Before adding stock of a drug, it is
				important to add the drug itself using the Add a New
				Drug screen, if this has not already been done. For more
				information on this, see Adding Drugs. It is also
				important that the distribution clinic for which the
				stock is intended has been added. For more information
				on this, see Adding Distribution Clinics. To add stock,
				log into the system and select

			<title>Creating Patient ARV Packages</title>
			<simpara>
				This section describes how to create monthly ARV
				packages for patients according to their prescriptions.
				Dispensing the package to the patient, either directly
				from the pharmacy or via a distribution clinic, is
				covered in the two subsequent sections. From the main
				screen, select
				<emphasis role="strong">
					Stock &amp; Dispensing
				</emphasis>
				. This will open the Stock Control screen - select
				<emphasis role="strong">
					Make Up Drug Packages For Patients

						date it left the pharmacy - this will be
						recorded when the package leaves the pharmacy to
						a patient or to a distribution clinic. See
						Dispensing from a Remote Clinic. You will not
						need to record the adherence information on this

				<listitem>

					</simpara>
				</listitem>
			</itemizedlist>
			<simpara>
				Both the above options will cause labels for all the
				drugs in the packages to be printed. If you choose
				Create Package for Later, a package cover label will
				also be printed.
			</simpara>

			<simpara>
				Select a distribution clinic from the drop-down list.
				This will bring up a list of all the patients for whom
				ARV packages should be made up. The list includes all
				patients at the selected clinic who have current
				prescriptions.
			</simpara>

			<simpara>
				Select a patient from the list to start making up a
				package for that patient. If you are looking for a
				specific patient, try using the search bar (the text box
				directly below the patient list). Typing a character or
				a few characters in this box will hide the Patient IDs
				in the list that do not contain the character(s) you
				have typed.
			</simpara>

			<simpara>
				Clicking a Patient ID in the list of waiting patients
				will cause information about the patient to come up in
				the Patient Information area, and information about the
				patient's current prescription to come up in the
				Prescription Information area. The drugs that a package
				for this patient should contain will be shown in red in
				the drugs table. At this point, also be aware of notes
				displayed for the patient. If the patient is a child,
				the system will warn you by placing a small icon showing
				a child next to the age field. This icon looks like
				this:

				<listitem>
					<simpara>
						When the system records a patient as having
						received a package, the patient's next
						appointment date is set according to how many
						months or weeks supply of ARV drugs the package
						contains. If you are dispensing directly to
						patients, the next appointment date will
						therefore be recorded from this screen. In this
						case, you can set the next appointment date in
						the Patient Information section. If you are

		<title>Printing Labels</title>
		<simpara>
			This section describes how to print a patient information
			label or an emergency label for a package, a drug in a
			package or a patient. Generally, printing of package and
			drug labels takes place during the creation of packages and
			is not controlled by the user; however this section also
			includes some hints for troubleshooting common problems with
			these automatically generated package and drug labels.
		</simpara>

		<sect1>
			<title>Printing a Custom Label</title>
			<simpara>
				A custom label is a label on which certain information
				(such as the Patient ID, or the dosage of a drug) is
				typed manually by the user, and not generated
				automatically by the system. This type of label is not
				associated with any other transaction in the system,
				such as the preparation of a package - this function
				exists only to allow the user to create custom labels in
				special circumstances. It does not talk to the database
				except to retreive the pharmacy details.
			</simpara>

			<simpara>
				Printing of emergency package cover, drug or patient
				labels takes place from the Print an Emergency Label
				screen. From the main screen, select
				<emphasis role="strong">Stock Control</emphasis>
				. This will bring up the
				<emphasis role="strong">Stock Control</emphasis>
				screen - from this screen, select
				<emphasis role="strong">
					Make up ARV Packages for Patients
				</emphasis>
				. This will bring up the Make up ARV Packages for
				Patients screen. From this screen, select Create
				Emergency Label. The Create Emergency Label screen looks
				like this:

					<textobject>
						<phrase>PrintEmergencyLabel.png</phrase>
					</textobject>
				</inlinemediaobject>
			</simpara>

			<simpara>
				First, select the kind of label you want to print. The
				editable areas are the areas of the label with a gray
				background. Clicking in one of these areas allows you to
				edit the text in this area. Note that for the package
				label, the Package ID will be replaced by the barcode
				representing it, and also printed in plain text below
				the barcode.
			</simpara>

			<simpara>
				Once you have a label that contains all the correct
				information, you can select the number of labels you
				wish to print for this patient from the drop-down box.
				Then, select
				<emphasis role="strong">Print</emphasis>
				to print the label(s). You will be prompted to select a
				printer; do this and press
				<emphasis role="strong">Print</emphasis>
				.
			</simpara>

			<title>Troubleshooting Label Printing</title>
			<simpara>
				Please note that the system is designed to use labels of
				size 3" by 2", and the Zebra range of label printers.
				These instructions apply to this printer, although they
				may still be useful if you have a different label
				printer. Please also note that these instructions are
				for computers running Microsoft Windows XP.
			</simpara>

			<simpara>
				If you need to be talked through these procedures, or if
				this does not solve your problem, please call the
				Cell-Life iDART help desk (see How to Get Help).

				<title>
					Setting your label printer as the default printer:
				</title>
				<simpara>
					Zebra printers seem to work better when set as the
					default printer. This is usually the first thing to
					try when you experience printing problems. To set
					your label printer as the default printer, do the
					following:
				</simpara>

				<simpara>
					Go to Start Programs, then Control Panel. This will
					bring up the Windows control panel. Click on
					Printers and Other Hardware, then View Installed
					Printers And Faxes. This should show all your
					installed printers. Use the right mouse button to
					click on the printer that prints your labels. This
					should bring up a menu â€“ select Set as Default to
					set this printer as your default printer.

					If your labels are not printing correctly, you may
					need to reset the paper size on your printer. To do
					this, go to Start Programs, then Control Panel. This
					will bring up the Windows control panel. Click on
					Printers and Other Hardware, then View Installed
					Printers And Faxes. This should show all your
					installed printers. Use the right mouse button to
					click on the printer that prints your labels. This
					should bring up a menu - select Properties, one of
					the last items on this menu. You should see the
					printer properties screen. Select Printing
					Preferences. The screen you see should look

			<title>Using the Patient Search</title>
			<simpara>
				Pressing
				<emphasis role="strong">Patient Search</emphasis>
				will bring up a list of the IDs and names of all the
				patients in the system. If you enter a chapter of a
				Patient ID or name, the system will shorten the list by
				hiding all those patients whose names and IDs do not
				contain the characters you have entered. You can also
				scroll through the list of patients using the arrows on
				the right hand side. For example, if the system has
				patients ABC112, ABC122 and ABC123, entering ABC will
				not hide any of the patient IDs, but entering ABC11 will
				hide the second and third IDs as only the first (ABC112)
				can match ABC11. Note that the search is not case
				sensitive, ie. AB, ab and Ab are the same.

				Note that most patient search screens will only allow
				you to search patients whose account status is
				<emphasis>active</emphasis>
				. For example, you can't add a prescription for an
				inactive patient, so there will not be inactive patients
				in the search on the Add/Update Prescription screen. The
				exception is the Update Patient screen, where you can
				search through all patients, active or inactive
			</simpara>

			<simpara>
				When you have found the patient you are looking for,
				click on the ID in the list. This will close the Patient
				Search screen and bring up the relevant information
				about the patient whose ID you selected. Clicking
				<emphasis role="strong">Cancel</emphasis>
				from the Patient Search screen will close the screen but
				not bring up information about any patients.
